miniNS is a compact version of [DIAMONDS](https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/Software/Diamonds)  (high-DImensional And multi-MOdal NesteD Sampling), a multi-purpose Bayesian inference suite created by [Corsaro & De Ridder 2014](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014A%26A...571A..71C) for parameter estimation. Condensed by [Carlos E. Munoz](https://github.com/munozcar)

ATMO_retrieve.cpp uses miniNS and the [ATMO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12971.pdf) atmospheric grid to quickly retrieve physical properties from exoplanetary transmission specra. Written by [Carlos E. Munoz](https://github.com/munozcar)
